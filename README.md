## Description:
This Java-based application is designed to collect and store weather data for the Canary Islands. Utilizing the OpenWeatherMap API, it retrieves weather forecasts, including temperature, humidity, cloudiness, wind speed, and more, specifically for the eight major islands. The application schedules regular data updates every six hours and stores this information in a SQLite database, creating separate tables for each island. The project effectively combines HTTP requests, JSON parsing, and database management, providing a robust solution for weather data collection and storage. The main components include OpenWeatherMapProvider for API interaction, SqliteWeatherStore for database operations, and WeatherController for orchestrating the overall data flow.
